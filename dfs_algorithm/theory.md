# Ways of implementing dfs algorithm
- It can be implemented in 2 ways.
1. Iterative approach - By using stack
2. Recursive approach - Even recursive approach uses stack, but you no need to implement stack explicitly.

# Stack data structure
- Will implement dfs algorithm through stack data structure.
- In stack data structure, data can be added only on top of exisitng data & also only recent data can be popped.
