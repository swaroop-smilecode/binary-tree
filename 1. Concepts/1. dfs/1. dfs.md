#### What is DFS?
--> DFS means, Depth First Search.</br>
--> If you want to explore the tree deeply(Until the base case is hit) in the path you firt step in, 
    then it needs to be implemented using recursion.
    The reason is: Recursion uses stack data structure underneeth.</br>
    So, when you are travelling from root node to leaf nodes of the tree, work is not done during that travel, 
    instead, work is stored inside the stack & once recursive step hits the base case, 
    then the work starts executing from leaf node to root node.</br>
--> That's why it is called Depth First Search.

#### Ways of implementing dfs algorithm
- It can be implemented in 2 ways.
1. Recursive approach - Underneeth, stack is used.
2. Iterative approach - You will use stack explicitly.

#### Stack data structure
- In Stack data structure, data is added on top of exisitng data & when popped, the most recently stored data comes out.
- To add the data: append()
- To pop the data: pop()

#### Time & Space complexity for Iterative approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

#### Time & Space complexity for Recursive approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(n)
