# Ways of implementing dfs algorithm
- It can be implemented in 2 ways.
1. Iterative approach - By using Stack
2. Recursive approach - Even recursive approach uses Stack, but you no need to implement Stack explicitly.

# Stack data structure
- In Stack data structure, data is added on top of exisitng data & when popped, the most recently stored data comes out.
- To add the data: append()
- To pop the data: pop()

# Time & Space complexity for Iterative approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

# Time & Space complexity for Recursive approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(n)
