#### What is DFS?
--> DFS means, Depth First Search</br>
--> It is implemented using Recursion. The reason is: since recursion uses the stack data structure 
    underneeth, when you are travelling from root node to leaf nodes of the tree, work is not done 
    during that travel, instead the work is stored inside the stack & once the recursive step hits 
    the base case, the work starts executing from leaf node to root node.</br>
--> Because of this stack data structure, the exploration & result calculation happens in a single 
    path till the dead end. That's why it is called Depth First Search.

#### Ways of implementing dfs algorithm
- It can be implemented in 2 ways.
1. Recursive approach - Underneeth, stack is used.
2. Iterative approach - You will use stack explicitly.

#### Stack data structure
- In Stack data structure, data is added on top of exisitng data & when popped, the most recently stored data comes out.
- To add the data: append()
- To pop the data: pop()

#### Time & Space complexity for Iterative approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

#### Time & Space complexity for Recursive approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(n)
