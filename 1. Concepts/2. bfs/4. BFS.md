# Ways of implementing bfs algorithm
- It can be implemented only in Iterative approach(By using Queue). 
  The reason is, to implement  BFS, we need Queue, where as Recursion is implemented by Stack.

# Queue data structure
- In Queue data structure, data is added from right side & popped from left side - hence, FIFO
- Think of Queue as waiting in the line of grocery store.
- To add the data: append()
- To pop the data: popleft()

# Time & Space complexity for Iterative approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
