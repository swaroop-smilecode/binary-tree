#### What is DFS?
- DFS means, Depth First Search.</br>
- Exploring a tree deeply(Until the base case is hit) in the path you firt step in is called as depth frist search &</br>
  & it's implemented using recursion. The reason is: Recursion uses stack data structure underneeth.
#### Implementing DFS 
DFS can be implemented in 2 ways.
1. Recursive apprroach
2. Iterative approach

I am just including about the Iterative approach just for reference purpose, in case neeeded in future.</br>
But, just forget about it. Recursive aproach is enough.</br>
