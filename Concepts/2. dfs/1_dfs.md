#### What is DFS?
- DFS means, Depth First Search
- It is implemented using `Stack`.

#### Implementing DFS 
DFS can be implemented in 2 ways.
1. Recursive apprroach
2. Iterative approach

I am just including about the Iterative approach just for reference purpose, in case neeeded in future.</br>
But, just forget about it. Recursive aproach is enough.</br>
