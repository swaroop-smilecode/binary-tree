#### What is BFS?
- BFS means, Breadth First Search</br>
- It is implemented using `Queue`.</br>

#### Ways of implementing bfs algorithm
It is implemented in Iterative approach(By using queue data structure).

#### Queue data structure
- In Queue data structure, data is added from right side & popped from left side - hence, FIFO
- Think of Queue as waiting in the line of grocery store.
- To add the data: append()
- To pop the data: popleft()
