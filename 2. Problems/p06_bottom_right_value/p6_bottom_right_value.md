<ins>What's the logic to find the bottom right value?</ins></br>
While navigating the tree using BFS, last node encountered is the Bottom right value.</br>
When queue becomes empty, it's an indication that just now, you traversed the last node.
While navigating, append left node first & then the right node. When the insertion is done
in this way, then only the last node traversed will be the Bottom right node.
