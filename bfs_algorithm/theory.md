# Ways of implementing bfs algorithm
- It can be implemented only in Iterative approach - By using Queue

# Queue data structure
- In Queue data structure, data is added from left side & popped from right side, hence the oldest stored data comes out.
- Think of Queue as waiting in the line of grocery store.
- To add the data: append()
- To pop the data: popleft()

# Time & Space complexity for Iterative approach
n = number of nodes
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
